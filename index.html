  <p>Hey! My name is Ankush and I’m a sophomore at <span class="red-bold"><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a></span> studying computer science.</p>

  <p>I’m currently exploring interests in tech for consumer finance and healthcare. On the finance side, I’ll be interning this summer with the product team at <span class="blend-bold"><a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a></span> helping build a platform for a better lending experience for all Americans. I also do technical and market research for <span class="pantera-bold"><a href="https://www.panteracapital.com/">Pantera Capital</a></span> on blockchain technologies and cryptoeconomics. On the healthcare side, I’m currently leading a project at the <span class="red-bold"><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/">Stanford School of Medicine</a></span>, leveraging AI to automate autism therapy and deploy it worldwide – something I’ve been working on for nearly 4 years now. This is a topic super near and dear to my heart, and I’m excited to hopefully share more soon.</p>
  <p>In the past, I directed Stanford’s premier hackathon (<span class="pink-bold"><a href="https://treehacks.com/">TreeHacks</a></span>), built software at <span class="green-bold"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a></span> for their new <span class="link"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge browser</a></span> (try it – you’ll be surprised), did cyber-intelligence work at <span class="purple-bold"><a href="https://www.blockcypher.com/">BlockCypher</a></span> (consulting for the <span class="pantera-bold"><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a></span>), developed computer vision methods for cancer diagnosis at <span class="red-bold"><a href="http://canarycenter.stanford.edu/">Stanford’s Canary Center</a></span>, built mobile data collection tools for the <span class="dhs-bold"><a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/translational-medicine/doing-research/dallas-heart/">Dallas Heart Study</a></span>, and did <a href="https://www.bmes.org/files/Doyle,%20Adele%20Extended%20Abstract.pdf"><span class="link">genomics research</span></a> at <span class="brown-bold"><a href="https://www.nri.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a></span>. I’ve also worked on a few unaffiliated projects; some of my favorites include better methods for <a href="./docs/style-transfer.pdf"><span class="link">neural artistic style transfer</span></a> on videos, an ASL interpreter for the Cortana voice assistant, and a <a href="https://github.com/ankushswar1/eanab-maker"><span class="link">robot that mixes drinks automatically</a></span>.</p>

  <p>I’m also interested in history & <a href="https://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/ujcim/issue/view/163/Winter-2019-2020"><span class="link">politics</span></a>, theology, <span class="link"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/12130960811?si=tJfqoWRgSmOkvKdJPE-r7w">music</a></span>, and literature (big fan of Haruki Murakami and Michael Crichton).</p>

  <p>Happy to chat about whatever! Currently based in the East Bay; feel free to reach out :)

  <!-- <h2>Hey! My name is Ankush.</h2>
  <p>I'm a current sophomore at <span class="highlight">Stanford</span> studying computer science with background & interests in artificial intelligence, consumer finance, and medicine.</p>
  <p>This coming summer, I'm excited to join <a href="https://blend.com/"><span class="highlight">Blend</span></a> in their mission of revitalizing the consumer banking experience for millions of Americans. I very recently learned what a mortgage is (to my own embarassment), but I think subpar financial literacy amongst people my age reflects a larger problem with the outdated nature of consumer finance and lending. I'm hoping to improve this experience a little bit this summer – and learn some important concepts for my future adult life (like how to buy a house!). Last summer, I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/"><span class="highlight">Microsoft</span></a> and had the chance to experience software engineering at scale. I helped build the engineering system and developer platform for the new chromium-based <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/">Edge</a> browser.</p>

  <p>Currently, I'm working on a project to automate <span class="highlight"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_response_treatment">early-stage behavioral interventions</a></span> for developmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder. Behavioral & learning disorders are a topic very near and dear to my heart, and I think there's huge potential to improve accessibility to high-quality therapy with technology. I'm really grateful to collaborate with some brilliant folks from <span class="highlight"><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/autismcenter.html">Stanford Medicine</a></span>, the <span class="highlight"><a href="https://education.ucsb.edu/autism">Koegel Autism Center</a></span>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/"><span class="highlight">Microsoft</span></a> as I explore this space further. More info coming soon!
  </p>

  <p>I also have deep technical interests in cryptography and computational methods for healthcare.</p>
  <P>With crypto, I:</P>
   
  <ul>
    <li>consult for <a href="https://www.panteracapital.com/"><span class="highlight">Pantera Capital</span></a>, a leading investment firm in this area, through which I've been able to gain early exposure to really interesting tech like the <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a>, <a href="https://alchemyapi.io/">Alchemy</a>, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879.pdf">zero-knowledge non-interactive proofs</a>.
    </li>
    <li>worked with <a href="https://www.blockcypher.com/"><span class="highlight">BlockCypher</span></a> and <a href="https://blockchainintel.com/"><span class="highlight">BlockchainIntel</span></a> to build business intelligence tools for currencies like <a href="https://www.dash.org/"><span class="highlight">DASH</span></a> in emerging markets like South America
    </li>
    <li>collaborated with the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/"><span class="highlight">FBI</span></a> on a multi-million dollar crypto theft (investigation, not the theft itself :P)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>With healthcare, I:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>built regression- and Markov-inspired models for tumorigenesis via the <span class="highlight">Hippo Pathway</span> in Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus at <span class="highlight"><a href="https://labs.nri.ucsb.edu/doyle/adele/">UC Santa Barbara</a></span></li>
    <li>investigated faster methods for genome-wide association studies with <span class="highlight">CRISPR/Cas-9</span> in collaboration with Stanford's <span class="highlight"><a href="http://lilab.stanford.edu/">Genetics Department</a></span></li>
    <li>researched spectroscopic & convolutional methods for <span class="highlight">early-stage cancer detection in 3D ultrasound</span> images with Stanford's <span class="highlight"><a href="https://canarycenter.stanford.edu/">Canary Center for Early Detection</a></span></li>
    <li>explored mobile phone-powered data aggregation for the <span class="highlight">Dallas Heart Study</span>, the world's largest population based study (with 6000+ patients), and authored an NSF Grant addendum for future use in clinical studies of <span class="highlight">Gulf War Syndrome</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some other random miscellaneous things I've worked on include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>an <span class="highlight">ASL interpreter for the Cortana voice assistant</span> to enable speech-impaired individuals to communicate with Cortana via an XBox Kinect Camera (see Satya Nadella try it out here!)
    </li>
    <li>a novel, fast, style-invariant architecture for <span class="highlight"><a href="https://github.com/ankushswar1/Fast-Stable-Neural-Style-Transfer-for-Videos">neural artistic style transfer of videos</a></span> that significantly reduces frame-to-frame inconsistencies (for Stanford's CS231N)
    </li>
    <li>a <span class="highlight"><a href="https://github.com/ankushswar1/eanab-maker">robot that mixes EANABs</a></span> (equally-attractive non-alcoholic beverages) at parties with a Raspberry Pi, a custom-designed PS/2 communication protocol, and disco lights (for Stanford's CS107E)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Stanford, I'm one of the co-directors of <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.treehacks.com/">TreeHacks</a></span>, the University's largest annual hackathon; joining the TreeHacks organizing team has been one of my most formative experiences in college and the event means a lot to me. I'm also involved with <a href="https://debate.stanford.edu/"><span class="highlight">Stanford Debate Society</span></a>, <span class="highlight"><a href="https://ashanet.org/">Stanford Holi</a></span>, and <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.pear.vc/garage">Pear VC's Garage Fellowship</a></span>.</p>
  
  <p>I also have a ton of niche, uncorrelated from Middle Eastern politics to music. Below are some things I like sharing with people (generally unsolicited):</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">books I've enjoyed recently</span>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood">Norwegian Wood</a> (Haruki Murakami), <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48053923-know-my-name">Know My Name</a> (Chanel Miller), <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262100-the-lowland">The Lowland</a> (Jhumpa Lahiri), <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39892820-axiomatic">Axiomatic</a> (Maria Tumarkin)
